# load-balancer
## üìå Why Use an ALB?

- **Distributes HTTP(S) traffic** across multiple EC2 instances for **high availability**.
- Supports **path-based and host-based routing**.
- Integrated with **Auto Scaling** and **Target Groups**.
- Supports **SSL termination** and **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.
- Useful for **microservices** or **containerized applications**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è When to Use

Use ALB when:
- You need **intelligent routing** (based on path or host).
- You want **centralized TLS termination**.
- You're running **microservices** in different containers.
- Your application demands **horizontal scaling** with multiple AZs.
